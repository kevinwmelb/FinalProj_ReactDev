Contrarian Investing Community (CIC): 

- Introduction:
  * The project is to build a web-based trading system to facilitate stock selection for contrarian investors.
  * It was inspired by Sir John templeton
  * The system is meant to support investors to make sound decisions. 
  * Via automated data collection, Iâ€™m trying to provide a good candidate list based on the comprehensive analysis across 5 factors:
    1) Stock Price Plunge/Surge
    2) Market Sentiment
    3) Macro-economics
    4) Micro-economics
    5) Wide Global View

- Key Features:
  * Macro-economics: Index Dashboard & News and Sentiment Search based on Topics/Industries
  * To Long: Symboal search based on price difference and exchange locations. After showing the selected stock charts for a quick browse, CIC provides links for investor to dig into the stock details.
  * Stock details show the company overview like PE ratio and EBITDA as well as the company related news and sentiment.

- Future Improvement:
  * To finish the "To short" tab.
  * To add more macro-economics data like the financial and politics news from other major countries as well as geo-polical and war news.
  * To add more historical data analysis for stock selection
  * Currently the free API has a limit of 5 queries per minute. In future, CIC needs commercial APIs or polishing around the free APIs.
